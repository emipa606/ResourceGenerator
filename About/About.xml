A spiritual successor of Atysoona's mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1583893207]Resource Generators[/url]

Adds a Resource Generator that can generate many resources in the game.
The amount of items spawned are determined by their marketvalue. 
Generators spawns items with a value equivalent of 75x Steel every two days as long as they have power.

Possible items to generate includes all stackable items that are either minable or is a stuff-type (Metal, Stone, Textile), vanilla and modded resources.
